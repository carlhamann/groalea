The file LMul_Branch_Test_XL.txt is a XL rule for this test case, which contain LMul commands within branches.
The file LMul_Branch_3Run_GroIMP.jpg is the 3D result after running the XL rule 3 times on GroIMP platform.  
The file LMul_Branch_3Run_Interface_XEG.xml is a XEG generated by interfacing package on GroIMP side, by which a wrong 3D result (DMul_Branch_3Run_Interface.jpg) will be pruduced.
The file LMul_Branch_4Run_GroIMP.jpg is the 3D result after running the XL rule 4 times on GroIMP platform. 
The file LMul_Branch_4Run_Interface.jpg is a wrong 3D result after running the XL rule 4 times on interface.   

Note: 
LMul_Branch_3Run_Interface_XEG.xml is just one possible resulting XEG generated by interfacing package on GroIMP side after 3 times running of the rule. Although these XEGs have different sequential order in the sense of XML, they indeed indicate the same tree graph sturcture (Guide by edge's properties: src_id, dest_id). However the interfacing package on OpenAlea side produces different 3D results depends on the XML sequential order, not the tree graph sturcture.
